## Summary
This web application mimics a basic website. This website displays static content in addition to allowing visitors to email me via a form. This application is developed using a front-controller design pattern.

## Features
The web application includes:  
	1. multi-page layout but without page refreshing when navigation links are clicked (using Bootstrap),  
	2. validation of input data and messages displayed on same page that informs the client if there was a problem with sending email,  
	3. email me by form submission (using PHPMailer), and  
	4. custom error handling.
